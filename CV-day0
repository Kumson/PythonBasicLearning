Today is for basic environment setting and modification.
Summary:
1.
Working locally
Installing Anaconda: If you decide to work locally, we recommend using the free Anaconda Python distribution（发行版）,
which provides an easy way for you to handle package dependencies. Please be sure to download the Python 3 version, 
which currently installs Python 3.6. 

Anaconda Virtual environment: Once you have Anaconda installed, it makes sense to create a virtual environment for the course.
To set up a virtual environment, run (in a terminal)

                conda create -n cs231n python=3.6 anaconda

to create an environment called cs231n.

Then, to activate and enter the environment, run

                source activate cs231n

To exit, you can simply close the window, or run

              source deactivate cs231n
**************************(important)
Note that every time you want to work on the assignment, you should run source activate cs231n (change to the name of your virtual env).
